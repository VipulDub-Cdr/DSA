The main motive of applying binary search is to reduce the complexity from O(n) to O(logn)
### Concept is - Eliminate the unecessary space and hence reduce the area for the search

**Question - Upper Bound**

Given a sorted array arr[] and a number target, the task is to find the upper bound of the target in this given array.

The upper bound of a number is defined as the smallest index in the sorted array where the element is greater than the given number.

##### Note: If all the elements in the given array are smaller than or equal to the target, the upper bound will be the length of the array.
