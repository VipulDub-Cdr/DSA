Question: Sort an array of integers in non-decreasing order.

Sample Input:
5
3 1 4 1 5

Sample Answer:
1 1 3 4 5

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100000
-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9

Approaches I used in the given solution:
Standard Library Sort (std::sort)

Additional points I included in the solution:
Used std::vector for dynamic array management.
Used <bits/stdc++.h> for convenience, including common headers.
Used standard input/output streams (cin/cout) for I/O.
